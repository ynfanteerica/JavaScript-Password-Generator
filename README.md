What is a password generator?

A password generator is a software tool that creates random or customized passwords for users. It helps users create stronger passwords that provide greater security for a given type of access.

How can it help you?
Password generators help those who have to constantly come up with new passwords to ensure authorized access for programs and to manage a large number of passwords for identity and access management.

This Password generators  app allow you to customize your passwords and adjust the character length and whether it includes uppercase or lowercase letters, numbers and special characters. Every time you click “generate,” a new random password is created based on your criteria.
